# Codex compatibility matrix

`Verified` means mocked or deterministic local tests pass. `Live required`
means a real provider or Codex client is still needed.

| Capability | Status | Boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Direct `setup/start/stop/status/doctor/restore/remove` | Verified | No OpenCodex execution or configuration |
| Loopback ACC listener and OAuth callback | Verified | Explicit `127.0.0.1` binds |
