# Codex integration

The supported path is direct and loopback-only:

```text
Codex Desktop -> Azure 127.0.0.1:<port> -> exact provider/model
```

OpenCodex is not a runtime, setup, auth, catalog, or lifecycle dependency. Azure does not start OpenCodex or modify its credentials.

## Commands

```text
azure codex setup [--model PROVIDER/MODEL]
azure codex start [--model PROVIDER/MODEL]
azure codex stop
azure codex status
azure codex doctor
azure codex restore
azure codex remove
```

`setup` prepares the direct Azure Responses provider without starting a process. `start` prepares the same configuration, starts one Azure-owned process, and verifies the loopback endpoint, `/v1/responses`, selected model, and generated catalog. `stop` terminates only the recorded Azure-owned process. `restore` and `remove` both stop that owned process and return Codex to a sanitized subscription configuration. `status` never displays secrets. `doctor` is read-only.

## Durable subscription baseline

Before Azure takes control, it creates `~/.config/azure/codex-restore.json` with:

1. A raw snapshot of the original `~/.codex/config.toml` and actively referenced catalog files, including whether each file existed.
2. A sanitized subscription baseline that preserves unrelated bytes and removes only active custom model routing, Azure-owned blocks, Azure/OpenCodex loopback providers, custom catalog references, and root custom models.

A valid baseline is never overwritten by repeated `start` calls. If the current config already points to Azure or OpenCodex, the custom routing is not accepted as the subscription baseline. Azure saves the raw state for recovery and stores the sanitized result as the restore target.

Every mutation receives a private timestamped backup first. Writes are atomic. A failed configuration, catalog, process, or endpoint verification rolls the command back to its pre-command files.

## Restore and recovery

`azure codex restore` restores the sanitized baseline, not a stale raw OpenCodex configuration. It removes active references to Azure, OpenCodex, ports `9999` and `10100`, `model_catalog_json`, and provider-prefixed root models. It deletes only catalogs proven to be Azure/OpenCodex-generated and located in known managed locations. Raw baseline data and timestamped backups remain available for recovery.

If no valid baseline exists, restore enters recovery mode. It first backs up the current files, constructs a sanitized subscription baseline from the current config, restores it atomically, and reports that recovery mode was used. Repeated restore calls are safe no-ops.

Azure never deletes `~/.codex`, login files, projects, history, MCP servers, trust settings, sandbox settings, approvals, skills, or unrelated preferences. It never edits provider keys or `~/.config/azure/.env`.

## Status and doctor

Status reports:

```text
Mode: Subscription | Azure | OpenCodex | Unknown
Azure process: Running | Stopped
Codex endpoint: ...
Active model provider: ...
Active catalog: ...
Subscription baseline: Valid | Missing | Recoverable
Restart ChatGPT required: Yes | No
```

Doctor parses root TOML routing and the selected provider table. A harmless word such as `opencodex` in a comment, MCP command, or inactive provider table does not fail the check. Active port `10100`, selected OpenCodex routing, or a selected OpenCodex catalog does fail.

Codex Desktop reads provider settings when its app process starts. After `start` or `restore` changes active configuration, fully quit and reopen ChatGPT Desktop when the command or status says restart is required.

## Catalog and routing

The shipped Codex registry contains exactly these three explicitly enabled models:

1. `nvidia/nvidia/nemotron-3-ultra-550b-a55b` — NVIDIA Nemotron Ultra 550B, 1M text context.
2. `openrouter/poolside/laguna-s-2.1:free` — Poolside Laguna S 2.1 through OpenRouter, configured for coding and creative writing.
3. `nvidia/stepfun-ai/step-3.7-flash` — Step 3.7 Flash through NVIDIA, with text and image input.

They resolve directly to their selected provider and upstream model. The Codex registry does not attach hidden fallback or image-reroute chains to them. Additional models appear only after they are explicitly added and enabled in `config.json`; authenticated provider discovery does not automatically flood the selector.

Catalog IDs are deterministic, unique, provider-prefixed, and exclude the Claude aliases `opus`, `sonnet`, and `haiku`. Direct Codex IDs route exactly to their selected provider/model.

## Authentication

```text
azure auth list
azure auth login kimi
azure auth login xai
azure auth login grok
azure auth login anthropic
azure auth status [PROVIDER]
azure auth logout PROVIDER
```

OAuth credentials are isolated by provider in macOS Keychain. Azure verifies that Codex authentication-like files are unchanged across lifecycle mutations and never prints their contents.

For provider trouble, run `azure auth status PROVIDER`, then log out and log in again. For an API-key rotation, revoke the old key at the provider, update the private `~/.config/azure/.env`, and restart Azure. Never paste a key into `config.json`, `config.toml`, a model catalog, logs, an issue, or a commit.
